      <p>
        My name is Isiah Olvera. I was born in Rancho Mirage CA, I played sports all through out
        my childhood all I knew was sports my childhood. After I graduated HighSchool I didn't really have a plan 
        or career so I decided to go to College of the Desert here in Palm Desert CA. I attended for 2 years before i decided to call it quits.
        I dropped out of school I just didn't want to learn anymore or take test.
        This was my biggest challenge I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I didn't have 
        a career or a plan for what I wanted to do. All I did was work and play video games everyday 
        but i knew I needed to do something with my self. I talked to my family and told me about USCD 
        coding bootcamp. I then decided to enroll and now im learning things I never knew before 
        or heard of ever but i am enjoying it.
